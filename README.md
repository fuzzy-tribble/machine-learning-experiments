# Usage
- For browsing and demos [reference the workbook content online](https://fuzzy-tribble.github.io/machine-learning)
- Or run workbooks interactively online here: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fuzzy-tribble/machine-learning/main
- Or run workbooks interactively on local machine like this:

```bash
# open VS code, clone or fork this repo then open terminal and run the following commands to create a virtual environment and install dependencies then you can run the notebooks locally

# create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
